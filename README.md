## Requirements

 - Have multiple "projects" or "products"
 - Reusable components
 - Use Proudly-found-elsewhere as much as possible
 - Simplicity / easy to understand

## Concepts

 - [ ] Workspaces: For enviroments
 - [ ] Custom Terraform Modules for Projects/Products
 - [ ] Terraform itself for dependency management
 - [ ] Folders for Layers (?) (is this layering really a best practise?)
 - [ ] Encrypted remote state in S3
 - [ ] Secrets stored in native AWS Services like SSM or Secrets Manager
